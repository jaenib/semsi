Proof on concept file sorting using GloVE: 

GloVe, coined from Global Vectors, is a model for distributed word representation. The model is an unsupervised learning algorithm for obtaining vector representations of words. 
This is achieved by mapping words into a meaningful space where the distance between words is related to semantic similarity. Different concepts show up as quasi linear mappings between words.
